# It's evaluation's world, we just live in it.
## A Ph.D. course at the University of Gothenburg, open to interested public.

This is the site for "It's evaluation's world, we just live in it.", a fully-online Ph.D. course taught by Asad Sayeed at the University of Gothenburg.  The point of the course, in a nutshell, is to take a somewhat wry look at the rather haphazard, insufficiently critiqued concept of evaluation that pervades langauge science and technology.  

Ph.D. students from the computational linguistics program at the department of Philosophy, Linguistics, and Theory of Science as well as from other departments and universities that will recognize the credits (7.5 ECTS), are welcome to take the course, and interested people from other institutions are also welcome to attend and present by contacting Asad directly (by Twitter DM or email) to obtain the meeting link 

This page is a work in progress.
